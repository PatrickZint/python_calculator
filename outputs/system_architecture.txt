Based on these system specifications, here are the high-level components and technology stack selections for this calculator application. 

**Component Design:**  
1) **Frontend**: This will be responsible to take input from users or display results in a user friendly interface (GUI). For GUI creation we can use frameworks like Tkinter which is included by default with Python, making it ideal due the functional requirements specified above for User Interface Interaction Features. 
2) **Backend/Logic Engine:** These components handle calculations and interact directly to frontend component via APIs or events triggered from UI interactions on buttons etc., For this calculator application we can use a simple python script which will define functions as per Functional Requirements section, these are the core computational functionalities of our app that take inputs perform operations & return outputs. 
3) **Data Validation:** This module validates data input by users before passing it to calculation engine ensuring only numerical values accepted and all others rejected preventing potential issues down line in application functioning based on Non-Functional Requirement: Security, Performance etc., We can implement this using python built-in functions or custom validation methods as specified above.
4) **Error Handling:** This component will handle exceptions occurring during calculations/data validations ensuring smooth operations of our app without crashes and informing users about the issue in an informative way fulfilling Non Functional Requirement: Maintainability, Usability etc., For this we can implement try-except blocks for error handling as specified above. 
5) **Logging:** This component records important events like errors or warnings that occurred during application runtime to monitor its performance over time and facilitate debugging if required,.. etc,. Python's built in logging library is suitable here fulfilling Non Functional Requirement: Logging And Monitoring..   We can log each operation with corresponding input, output & any exceptions.
6) **Server/API:** If our calculator app needs to be accessed from different devices or through web interface then we need a server component which acts as an intermediary between frontend and backend,.. etc,. Python Flask framework could fulfill this requirement if it is necessary for the application..  It's lightweight, easy-to-use yet powerful tool fulfilling Non Functional Requirement: Scalability.
    - **Technology Stack Selection:**  
1) Frontend (Tkinter): This will be used to create GUI in Python which would interact with backend through defined APIs or events triggered from UI interactions on buttons,.. etc,.  It‚Äôs a standard python library so no need for additional setup and easy-to-use.   
2) Backend/Logic Engine(Python Scripting language - General Purpose): This will contain the core computational logic of our application i.e., functions to handle arithmetic operations,...etc,. Python is chosen as it's versatile, powerful yet simple scripting Language fulfilling all functional requirements and nonfunctional ones like Security,.. etc,. 
3) Data Validation (Built-in python methods/Custom validation): This component will validate user data before passing onto calculation engine ensuring only numeric values are accepted.   We can use Python‚Äôs built in functions or write custom validations as per our needs..   
4) Error Handling(Try Catch blocks, Custom Exception handling - General Purpose Language feature): It handles exceptions and provides informative error messages,.. etc,.  This is a part of any programming language so no additional setup needed.   But for better maintainability can consider writing specific exception classes based on type or category.,..   
5) Logging (Python‚Äôs in-built logging library - General Purpose Language feature): Used to log important events, errors & warnings,.. etc,. No need extra modules as Python provides built in libraries fulfilling Non Functional Requirement: Maintainability.  The logs will be helpful for debugging and monitoring purposes during the application runtime..  
6) Server/API (Flask / Django - Web Frameworks ): If our calculator app needs to accessed from different devices or through web interface then we need a server component,.. etc,. Python has various frameworks like Flask, Django which are easy-to-use yet powerful fulfilling Non Functional Requirement: Scalability. It provides flexibility and extensibility for developing complex applications with multiple components.,..   
Remember every application is unique so these guidelines might not apply in all cases but can be used as a base to design your system architecture,.. etc,. . Happy coding!. üòÑüë©‚Äçüíª  This high-level overview of the technology stack and component designs will facilitate easier understanding for development team while working on individual components.
