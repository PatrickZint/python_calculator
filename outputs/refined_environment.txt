To develop the mentioned environment-constrained application with these requirements, here's an outline of what needs consideration in terms of both technical architecture design as well security measures for python software engineering projects . 

1) Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): Adopt Agile or Iterative model to manage development effectively. This is because Python has great support and a large community which can assist during the implementation phase, thereby reducing time-to-market while also facilitating continuous integration/continuous deployment practices that are crucial for secure software design . 

2) Code Quality: Use tools such as Pylint or Pyflakes to ensure good code quality. This not only increases maintainability but prevents potential security vulnerabilities by catching errors and bugs early in the development phase, thus providing a strong foundation of reliability within your application structure that’s crucial for secure software design . 

3) Security: Use built-in libraries like hashlib or passlib to manage passwords securely. For database operations use SQLAlchemy ORM which is well designed with security measures incorporated into it as one key component in Python's ecosystem, making your application more robust against threats and vulnerabilities that might otherwise come from lower level code .
    - Use HTTPS for network communication – this ensures the data transmitted over networks cannot be intercepted or tampered. This can protect sensitive information like login credentials etc..  
    
4) Performance: To ensure reasonable performance, consider using caching mechanisms such as Redis which is easy to integrate with Python and provides fast read/write operations thereby reducing server load .  Also use a proper ORM (Object-Relational Mapper), for example SQLAlchemy can improve application speed by generating efficient database queries.  
    - Asynchronous programming could be used where possible, using libraries such as asyncio or trio to avoid blocking the event loop and thus allowing your program to perform more tasks in less time . 
    
5) Scalability: Design for scalability from day one; applications should not have a hard limit on how much data they can handle. Consider Microservices architecture if it's an appropriate fit depending upon application requirements or complexity level, which will help you develop and maintain your software at scale with Python’s robust ecosystem . 
    - For cloud deployment consider using services like AWS (Amazon Web Services) that provide scalability out-of-the box for serverless architectures. This can be very helpful in handling increasing user traffic efficiently without much manual intervention required from the developer's end and hence increases application performance over time by ensuring constant optimization .  
    
6) Testing: Make sure to follow Test Driven Development (TDD). It will not only ensure that your code works as expected but also help you catch bugs early in development. Python has a wide variety of testing libraries like unittest, pytest and nose which can be used for different types of tests . 
    - Also make use CI/CD tools such Jenkins or Travis-CI to automate the software build process ensuring consistent results across all environments thus making your application robust against threats from outside sources i.e., security vulnerabilities that might otherwise come due untested changes in codebase over time , resulting into potential performance degradation . 
    
7) Use logging libraries like Python’s built-in library 'logging' to keep track of the applications behavior, especially errors and warnings which are critical for debugging as well providing meaningful insights about application health. This will also help you analyze user interactions with your software effectively improving its overall efficiency over time . 
    - Moreover use appropriate logging levels depending upon severity such that error logs do not flood while warning/informational level can provide necessary context to debug problems quickly when they occur, resulting into performance improvements and improved UX for end-users.  
    
8) Documentation: Use tools like Sphinx or MkDocs which will help in maintaining the project documentation effectively making it easier both during development phase as well post its completion . This also helps other developers understand your codebase faster reducing time spent on initial setup when joining a new team, thus improving application performance overall over longer term.
    - Python’s docstring convention can be followed throughout for better readability and understanding of each function or module's purpose by both the author as well others contributing to it in future .  This will not only ensure clear communication within teams but also serves a crucial role during system maintenance/updates with improved traceability, thus resulting into faster debugging when issues occur.
    - Python’s PEP8 style guide can be used for writing clean and maintainable code ensuring readability is maintained regardless of the number years or individual who might need to revisit it .  This not only improves application performance but also contributes positively towards long term success by making system maintenance easier over time , resulting into a cost savings in terms reduced debugging/fixing costs due less frequent issues.
    - Hence, following these practices will lead you on the right track for developing secure and highly performant Python applications .  It is critical to ensure that security measures are built from day one while keeping an eye towards performance throughout development process , thus making a robust product in line with end-user demands whilst offering optimal system utilization.
