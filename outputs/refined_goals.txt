Based on your requirements for the future software project - "Code a Simple Calculator in Python with User Interface", here are some specific goals that you might want to refine and consider when developing this application, along with their related tasks or subtasks below them:

Goal 1 : Create Basic Arithmetic Operations Functionality (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication & Division)
- Task A. Design the calculator functions for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/). These will take two numbers as input and return a number which is result of operation performed on those inputs 
    - Implement function to add/subtract: (a + b or a - b ) where '+' represents Addition, '-' represent Subtraction. Similar tasks for '*', '/' operations  
- Task B : Develop the error handling mechanisms such that calculator handles division by zero and invalid input scenarios gracefully without crashing 
    - Implement exception to handle ZeroDivisionError while performing Division operation in task A above or create separate function which checks whether denominator is non-zero before executing divison. Similarly, develop mechanism for checking valid inputs (non empty/null)  
    
Goal : Create User Interface using Tkinter Library: The interface should allow users perform operations and display results 
 - Task C Design the user friendly GUI with clear labels & buttons to indicate which operation is being performed or result displayed on screen. It must also provide an option for input of numbers, as well a button/command that performs calculation based upon selected operator   
    	- Implement Tkinter library functions like 'Label', ‘Entry’,'Button' etc., and connect them appropriately with the defined calculator function to display results  
- Task D: Ensure UI is responsive (i.e it updates result immediately when user enters inputs) or provides mechanism for multiple operations in sequence   
    	- Implement logic that calls appropriate operation functions on button click/input entry, store intermediate values if required and update GUI with new calculation	result  . For example pressing '+' after a number should add to the stored	value	and	update	new	display	on	the	top	line	(or	wherever	is	set	for	output)	.   Similarly	,	final	input	'='	to	get	current result.   
- Task E: Implement functionality for clearing or resetting calculator operations and inputs,	start over with fresh calculation 	- Add	a	"Clear"	functionality	in	Tkinter	that	resets	and	hides	the	display	value	on	top	line	(or	wherever	is	set	for	output)	,	while	retaining	input	state	.   The	'C'	key	to	do	this.   
- Task F: Validate user inputs to ensure only numerical values are accepted and nothing else - This can be done by checking data type or regular expression of input, reject non numeric string entries  .    

Remember : It is recommended that the design work for GUI starts before coding actual functions as this will give you a clear picture on how different components (buttons etc.) should interact with each other and result display. And also considering future enhancements to your calculator such as complex operations or memory functionality can help in better designing of UI & function implementation 
   Happy Coding !   
Note : This is just one possible way	to	break	the	final	result into	a	set	of	tasks	and	is	targeted	for	'Python	newbie'	type	i	nvironment,	in	case	where	it’s	driving	,	get more advanced	with	current	state	.	If	this	wants	toperform	on	e.g.,	C++,	add	Bjarne	S._Stroustrup	_recommendations	to	the	list!
