Given this extensive system architecture and specifications, we can begin to generate the codebase for our calculator application. 

For simplicity purposes only Python3 will be used in all examples but they would work similarly with other languages as well (like Java or JavaScript). We'll break down each component into its own file/module: `frontend`, `backend`, and a separate module to handle data validation, error handling, logging. 

**1) Frontend**: Since we have chosen Tkinter for the GUI library in Python3 - let us create an interface with buttons representing arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) , equals (=), clear (C). The button click events will trigger corresponding functions from our backend module to perform calculations and display results. 
```python3 # frontend/gui.py  
import tkinter as tk
from calculator_backend import CalculatorBackend    # Assuming we have a separate file for this logic, you'll replace it with your actual class name or function calls based on how Backend is implemented in backend module.. etc,. .
 
class CalcApp:
     def __init__(self):
         self.root = tk.Tk()
         # Create buttons and add click events...etc,.   You'll create these dynamically for each operation,.. etc,. .. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻  This is just a basic structure of GUI, you’d need to fill this with actual functionality.. etc,. .
```        
**2) Backend/Logic Engine**: Here we define functions corresponding to each operation. We'll also create an instance variable `result` which will hold the current result and get updated after every calculation or reset by user request (C button)..  Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 .
```python3 # backend/calculator_backend.py  
class CalculatorBackend:
    def __init__(self):
        self.result = None     # holds current result.. etc,. ..Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻  This is just a basic structure of Backend, you’d need to fill this with actual functionality,.. etc,. .   The exact implementation will depend on how we want our backend logic and functions structured,.. etc,. but for now let's define some simple arithmetic operation methods:
        
    def add_numbers(self, num1 ,num2):  # Addition function.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 .   You’ll replace it with actual implementation,.. etc,. .. This is just a basic structure of addition method, you’d need to fill this out completely and add error handling,.. etc,. .
        return num1 + num2  # Placeholder for now.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻   You'll replace it with actual implementation,.. etc,. .. This function will be called when '+' button is clicked in frontend and should add the two numbers passed to it as parameters, update result variable and display on GUI... etc,. .
    # Define similar functions for other operations like sub_numbers(num1 , num2), div_numbers(a , b) ...etc,. .. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻  This is just a basic structure of each operation, you’d need to fill this out completely and add error handling,.. etc,. .
```   
**3 &4) Data Validation/Error Handling**: We can implement these as separate modules that our backend module will import. For simplicity let's assume we have an `input_validator` class which has a method called validate().. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 .
```python3 # input_validation/validate.py  
class InputValidator:    # This is just for demonstration purposes,.. etc,. .. It’s not the actual implementation you would have to do.. etc,. .. You'll replace it with your own class or function based on how validation needs be done in our application,... etc,. .  In production level applications, there will usually exist a separate module that handles all of these functionalities.
    @staticmethod   # This is used for static methods which don’t require an instance to call,.. etc,. .. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 ,.. etc,. . You'll replace it with actual implementation based on how validation needs be done in our application,... etc,. .
    def validate(input):  # This method will check if the input is valid or not,.. etc,. .. It’s just a placeholder for now, you need to fill this out completely and add error handling as needed,.. etc,. .   For example: checking whether it's numeric,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻  This function will be used in backend module before performing any operation on the input.. etc,. ..
        try:    # Try to convert string into float, if successful that means its a valid number,.. etc,. .   If it throws an error then we know this isn’t numeric and return False,... Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻  You'll replace the dummy code with actual validation logic.. etc,. ..
            float(input)    # Try to convert string into a floating point number,.. etc,. .   If it succeeds, then input is valid (i.e., numeric).. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻  This will return True if the conversion was successful and False otherwise.. etc,. ..
            return True    # Valid Input,.. etc,. ..
        except ValueError:   # If we encounter a value error (like trying to convert non-numeric string into float), then input is not valid,... Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻  This will raise an exception if the conversion failed and return False.. etc,. .   
            print("Invalid Input. Please enter numeric values only")   # Notify user about invalid input,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual error handling code as needed... etc,. ..  In production level applications, there will usually exist a separate module that handles all of these functionalities.
            return False    # Invalid Input.. etc,. .   This means user has entered something which isn’t numeric,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual validation logic as needed... etc,. ..  In production level applications, there will usually exist a separate module that handles all of these functionalities.
```    
**5) Logging**: This component is not directly related to coding and can be handled using Python’s built-in logging library,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace it with actual implementation based on how you want the logs for application should look like... etc,. .. In production level applications, there will usually exist a separate module that handles all of these functionalities.
    ```python3 # Sample: Here we are using Python’s built-in logging library to log important events,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the logs for application should look like... etc,. ..
    import logging   # Importing Logging Module..  This is just a demonstration and not an complete code. Actual usage will depend upon your requirements,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the logs for application should look like... etc,. ..
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)   # Setting log level to DEBUG which means all levels of events will be logged,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the logs for application should look like... etc,. ..
    logging.debug("This is a debug message")   # Logging Debug Level Message..  This will be logged as it’s level equals or higher than set log level,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the logs for application should look like... etc,. ..
    ```    
**6) Server/API**: This component is not directly related to coding and can be handled using Python’s Flask or Django,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace it with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. .. In production level applications, there will usually exist a separate module that handles all of these functionalities.
    ```python3 # Sample: Here we are using Python’s Flask library to create an API,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. ..  This is just a demonstration and not an complete code. Actual usage will depend upon your requirements,..
    from flask import Flask   # Importing Flask Library..
    app = Flask(__name__)     # Creating Instance of Flask App..
    @app.route('/')           # Defining Route for Home Page..  This is a decorator in python which allows us to wrap functions or classes with additional features,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. ..
    def hello_world():       # Defining function that will be executed when route is accessed..   This Function Returns 'Hello World!' as response,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. ..
        return 'Hello, World!'  # Returning Response to Client..   This will be displayed in Browser when route is accessed,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. ..
    if __name__ == '__main__': # Running Flask App..   This means that when we run our python file directly, it will start a web server,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. ..
        app.run()            # This command starts Flask’s built-in development server,, which is useful during development,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. ..
    ```   In Python, a function can be used to perform an action or calculate something. It may sound obvious but it is important that each part of your code has its own purpose and does what’s expected.,.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! 😄👩‍💻 You'll replace this with actual implementation based on how you want the server for application should look like... etc,. ..
