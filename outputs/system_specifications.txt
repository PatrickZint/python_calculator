1) Functional Requirements – The application should perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). It must also have error handling mechanisms for scenarios where divisions by zero occur or invalid input is supplied. Furthermore, it needs to incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter library in Python which will allow users interact with the software through buttons clicked on an attractive GUI that represents these inputs visually such as numbers and arithmetic operators. The application should connect its code logic from python script into this design so when button clicks are detected by our events, it performs calculations instantly displaying results back to user interface via Tkinter or similar libraries in order for users see operations' outcomes immediately after entering them through the software’s graphical input method system-like representation of inputs visually such as numbers and arithmetic operators.
    - The application must also allow storing data locally using SQLite3 database, which should be integrated seamlessly with our python script to save user history records containing all previous calculations for easy retrieval or deletion by users if needed later on .  This would provide a feature where the calculator can remember operations performed before so that they could potentially reuse them in future.
     - A simple API (Application Programming Interface) must also be provided which allows other applications such as mobile apps, web-based interfaces etc., to interact with our software by sending HTTP requests and getting responses back from it for executing calculations .  This will open up possibilities of extending its functionality beyond just desktop usage into wider range platforms.
    - The application should support advanced mathematical functions like square root which can be added later based on evolving user needs, feedback or other future requirements identified during iterations over time as suggested by Agile/Iterative development model recommended in Environment Profile .  This would make it more versatile and useful for a broader spectrum of users with varying levels expertise & capabilities.
     - The application should also support complex mathematical operations like logarithmic functions etc., if the user requirement is there but these will be added later based on evolving requirements identified during iterations as suggested by Agile/Iterative development model .  This flexibility allows us to continually improve our software product over time with feedback from users, meeting their changing needs.
      - It must also support basic unit conversions like length (meter <-> kilometer), temperature etc., which can be added later based on evolving user requirements as suggested by Agile/Iterative development model .  This feature will make it more useful and versatile for a wider range of applications outside the standard arithmetic calculations that are its core functionality.
   - Furthermore, an in-built help system should also provide users with information about how to operate this software effectively , which can be accessed via button click or by typing commands within input field . This will make it more user friendly and reduce support requests from end customers due misunderstanding of application features/functionality after its initial deployment phase.
  - The calculator must have a feature that allows the users, who are visually impaired to operate using voice-commands for all operations including mathematical functions like square root or logarithmic etc., which can be added later based on evolving requirements identified during iterations as suggested by Agile development model . This will make it more inclusive and accessible providing benefits also not only blind but other individuals with visual impairments too.
    - The application should include a feature to change language (English, Spanish), so the calculator responds in selected user's preferred languages which can be added later based on evolving requirements identified during iterations as suggested by Agile development model . This will make it more accessible and beneficial for international users who are comfortable with using software written/spoken their native tongue.
    - Lastly but importantly , The application should include a feedback mechanism where end-users could rate the app's usability or suggest features that they would like to see in future versions of this calculator . This will be an integral part not only for continual improvement and iteration process as suggested by Agile/Iterative development model, also providing valuable insights from actual users about their needs , thus ensuring its practicality & effectiveness.
 2) Non-Functional Requirements: The system should follow the PEP8 style guide in Python programming to ensure clean code with readability being maintained regardless of how long it might be before others need access or maintenance . This will allow for easier understanding by both author and other contributors contributing later on , thus saving time during debugging/fixing costs due less frequent issues. 
    - Similarly, all docstrings conventions in Python should also follow to ensure better communication within teams even after years of development when new team members join them or system maintenance takes place . This will contribute positively towards long term success by making the codebase more maintainable and manageable over time , thus resulting into a cost savings.
    - The application must be highly performant, scalable & secure as mentioned in Environment Profile for its deployment on cloud platforms like AWS which provide scalability out-of-the box . This will ensure that even with increasing user traffic it performs consistently without much manual intervention required from developers end , thus improving overall system performance over time.
    - The application should also adhere to Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology while being developed, ensuring code works as expected and catching bugs early in development phase which helps optimize for consistent results across all environments making software robust against threats coming due untested changes . This will help maintain the quality of our product at a high level throughout its lifetime.
    - Moreover it should follow Python’s logging conventions to keep track applications behavior, especially errors & warnings that are crucial in debugging and improving application performance over time while providing meaningful insights about software's health which is essential for system maintenance/updates . This will help analyze user interactions effectively with the calculator thereby increasing its overall efficiency.
    - The whole development process should follow Agile or Iterative model as mentioned to manage it more efficiently, making better use of tools like Pylint & Pyflakes ensuring good code quality and catching errors early in coding phase reducing time-to-market while also facilitating continuous integration/continuous deployment practices . This will lead us on the right track for developing secure , highly performant Python applications.
    - Finally it should be easy to install, update or remove from any system with a simple installation script which can guide user through whole process of installing application effortlessly thus saving their time and effort while making sure smooth uninstallation when its no longer required . This will ensure better adoption & longevity for our software product as users find ease in using them.
    - The GUI design should follow modern UI/UX principles ensuring intuitive navigation , attractive visual layout appealing to both casual end-users who might not be tech savvy nor familiar with calculator apps or professional ones like accountants needing precise calculations . This will attract wider user base and increase software usage frequency & duration over time which in turn would contribute towards its success.
    - Furthermore, the system should provide clear error messages when something goes wrong during calculation to aid users quickly identify problem areas , thus improving application usability for end-users while also making their experience with this calculator more pleasant overall . This will reduce user frustration and increase satisfaction level leading potential growth of software product over time by word-of-mouth recommendations.
    - All data should be encrypted before storing in SQLite3 database to protect users privacy ensuring secure transactions even if system is breached or accessed without authorization , thus giving added layer security for sensitive information like login credentials etc..  Moreover, the application must follow HTTPS protocol during network communications preventing potential threats from outside sources and protecting user’s personal data securely over networks . This will make our software more reliable & trustworthy among users resulting into increased adoption rate.
    - The system should be designed to support multiple platforms including but not limited to Windows , Mac OS, Linux etc., ensuring wider range of end-user base it can cater towards thus maximizing potential market for this calculator application in long run . This would also help us understand any platform specific issues early and address them before they become significant problems.
    - Lastly the software should be designed keeping accessibility into consideration not only visually impaired users but all other categories too like color blind or low vision folks , elderly people etc., ensuring equal access & usability for everyone regardless of their abilities . This will make our product more inclusive making it accessible to a broader range audience leading towards its success and acceptance in long run.
