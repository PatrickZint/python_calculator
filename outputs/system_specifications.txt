Based on this information, I'll provide a detailed system specification for our simple calculator application. The functional requirements can be divided into two main parts - the calculation functionality and user interface interaction features (including error handling). 

**Functional Requirements:**  
1) **Calculation Functions**: For each arithmetic operation (+,-,*,/), we need to design functions that take in two numeric inputs from users or previous calculations. These should return a single numerical output after performing respective operations on those numbers:   
- Addition (a + b): Inputs 'a' and 'b', Output is sum of both ‚Äì e.g., add_numbers(3,5) -> Returns : 8  
- Subtraction (a - b): Inputs are same as addition operation but output will be subtraction result‚Äîe.g.- sub_numbers(10,7)->Returns: 3   
and so on for multiplication and division functions too..    
2) **Error Handling**: The calculator should handle several types of errors gracefully without crashing or breaking the application such a way that it provides an informative error message to user about what went wrong. These includes but are not limited to - Division by Zero Error, Non-numerical Inputs,.. etc.,   For example: 
```python3 # Sample function for division operation with exception handling    def div_numbers(a , b):       try:           return a/b;     except ZeroDivisionError as err :          print ("Caught an error:" + str(err) +" Please make sure denominator is not zero");   ``` 
This will catch any attempts to divide by zero and provide informative message about the issue. Similarly, you can add similar exception handling for other operations too..    Also note that function should also handle non-numeric inputs,.. etc., which might be provided as input in user interface,...etc,. And return appropriate error messages if such cases occur... 
3) **User Interface Interaction Features**: We need to design a responsive GUI, where users can perform the operation and display results. It must include buttons or other interactive elements for each of these operations (+,-,*,/), an input area (or multiple areas depending on your application's needs )for numbers,.. etc.,   And also have placeholders(labels) showing result after performing a particular calculation..
4) **Multiple Operations in Sequence**: The interface should allow users to enter new inputs or perform additional calculations without restarting the program, and update results dynamically. This can be achieved by using event-driven programming approach where user's interaction with GUI triggers certain events that cause functions associated (i.e., operation function for specific buttons).. etc,.
5) **Reset Functionality**: Implement a 'Clear/ Reset All' functionality in your interface which resets all the displayed values on top line or wherever it‚Äôs set to output, while retaining input state..  For example pressing C	key	to	do	this	in	Tkinter	is	a	'Command':	.   reset_all()	#function definition for	event handler,..   
6) **Validation of User Input**: Validate that only numerical inputs are accepted and nothing else. This can be done by checking data type or regular expression matching.. etc,. If non-numeric string entries found then it should give an error message to the user so they know what‚Äôs wrong,...etc,.   Validation	function	e.g.,	is_valid(input)	#function	def	to	check	input	type	.   
     These functions/validators can be used at multiple places in your program,.. etc,.  For example: before passing a string input from GUI or API to any calculation function, you should check if it‚Äôs valid using is_numeric()	function..   This will prevent potential issues down the line and make sure only appropriate inputs are being processed by our application,...etc.,
    ```python3 # Sample validation method for checking numeric value:  def	is_valid(input) :     try	:          float (	input )	#try	to convert input to	float	.         return True	if	the conversion is successful	(	i.e	,	value	is	a valid number	)	else	return False	for	invalid inputs..      except ValueError as	valerr	:           print ("Caught an	error:"	+	str(valerr)+	"Please	check	and	try again	with a numeric	input")   ```
**Non-Functional Requirements:**  The following are the non functional requirements that need to be considered:   
1) **Security**: Make sure all user inputs and data transfers between client/server is encrypted. Use HTTPS instead of HTTP when transmitting sensitive information over network layers as this encrypts	the transmitted	data preventing eavesdropping attacks	and man-in	in	the	middle	(MitM	)	troubles..   Also	check	&	vali date	all	input	s from users	to prevent SQL	injections, command injection or	XSS attack possibilities depending	on	context	. 
2) **Performance**: Use multiprocessing when tasks can be parallelized to utilize multiple cores and speed up the processing time for CPU intensive operations,.. etc,. Try	and	test	new	functionalities	for	the	longest	data	input	(i.e	,	averylarge	set	o	pnumbers	)	to	check	if	it‚Äôs	faster	with	out	causing	huge	memor		yover	u p	.
3) **Maintainability**: Make sure code is clean, modular and easy to understand so that it can be easily maintained by a new developer,.. etc,. Also	document	the	new	functionality	and	add	test	s	for	that	t o	check	if	it	is	w orking as	expected..   Use	a	l	integrated	D	evelopment	E	nvironment	(IDE)	, such	a	s	P y C	h	r m	o n	to	get	in	line	error	messing,	auto-complete feature,.. etc,.
4) **Scalability**: If your application has large amounts data or needs high performance,...etc,. then consider using a lower-level programming language like GoLang which is	statically	t yped	and	compiles	to	machine code making	it	faster than	P	y	T	h o	n	.   However	if	the	p	e	rfo	m	is	a	L	i	b r	a tio n	,	o	r	I/Ooperations	(i.e.,	file	I/O	),	w e	my	g	E	l	u	t	s	d	C		H a  T H	G	N	D	e	R	S	F	P	T	B	N	n	n	V	Q	c	q	S	f	y	m
5) **Compatibility**: Python has strong support across multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux). However if compatibility is an issue then languages like GoLang can be considered which are statically compiled but have good cross-platform libraries.  Lastly	the	s	a	l	e	t	d	r	G	E	H	I	g	V	n	B	f	u	Q	y	w	h	N	c	T	R	o	L	D	V	C		V	A	P	W	d	i	H	k	S	F	f	q	Y	b	q	S	f	y	m	.
6) **Usability**: The application should be user-friendly and intuitive to use. Provide clear instructions or guidelines for the users on how they can interact with your interface,.. etc,. Make sure	the	a	p	p	l	I	g	G	o	R	V	H	n	B	r	E	L	c	Q	b	q	S	f	y	m	.
7) **Accessibility**: The application should be accessible by all types of user, including those using assistive technologies like screen readers. Ensure that colors have enough contrast and the app is navigable with a keyboard,.. etc,. .  Lastly	the	s	a	l	e	t	d	r	G	E	H	I	g	V	n	B	f	u	Q	y	w	h	N	c	T	R	o	L	D	V	C		V	A	P	W	d	i	H	k	S	F	f	q	Y	b	q	S	f	y	m	.
8) **Logging and Monitoring**: Use logging to record important events, errors or warnings in your application. Implement monitoring so that you can track the performance of your app over time,.. etc,. .  Lastly	the	s	a	l	e	t	d	r	G	E	H	I	g	V	n	B	f	u	Q	y	w	h	N	c	T	R	o	L	D	V	C		V	A	P	W	d	i	H	k	S	F	f	q	Y	b	q	S	f	y	m	.

Remember, every application has unique requirements so these are just general guidelines that you might need based on specific cases. Happy coding!. 
```python3 # Sample: Here we are writing a simple hello world function in Python to test if the environment is set up correctly def helloworld(): print("Hello World!") HelloWorld() ```   This will output "Hello World!" If everything's working fine.. Enjoy your development journey !!!! üòÑüë©‚Äçüíª
